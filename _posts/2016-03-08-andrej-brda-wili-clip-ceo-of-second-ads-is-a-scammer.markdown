All our allegations are fully backed by evidence. We present links to documents in the present text. No information is given about innocent people or even about his accomplices.


Andrej Brda is the real person under the Second Life avatar Wili Clip.

He is the CEO of Second Ads, one of the most profitable companies of Second Life. He was claiming having monthly revenue of 1,600,000 lindens with expenses of only 157,000 lindens (of course, he changed this data, but we have a scan of the original page):



In 2011 and 2012, he was paying on certain months 400,000-650,000 lindens in dividends:



Confirm here: https://www.onlinecapex.com/dividends/history/ADS (you will need a Capex account to access this page).

Taking in account the usual value of the linden of about 1 usd=250 Lindens, we are talking about monthly revenue of 6400 USDs.

In March 2011, Andrej Brda made an initial public offer of shares on his company on the Second Life Stock Exchange SL Capex (www.onlinecapex.com) and, in September 2011, he did a supplementary public offer. Because of a stock-split 1 to 5, the company ended with 17,500,000 shares and the CEO with only 47.3% of them.

The IPO was for 1,200,000 shares at 2L with a total amount of shares of 3,000,000 (http://www.sluniverse.com/php/vb/commercial-announcements/55757-second-ads-has-launched-ipo.html), thus the total Brda earned should be 2,400,000L. He claims he didn't sell 60,000 shares without presenting reliable evidences, but he confessed that he received 2,280,000 lindens from the IPO (see his message quoted here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1346981.msg13896941#msg13896941).

The SPO was planed for more 1,500,000 shares (see http://www.secondads.com/ADS_SPO_Prospectus.pdf), but at 6L each (check https://www.onlinecapex.com/home/story/ADS/4030). The earned amount should have been 9,000,000L. But on the same post Brda claims he only earned 3,000,000 Lindens. However, he doesn't present any evidence that the final number of shares sold was changed from 1,500,000 to 500,000 shares.

Therefore, according to published documents, the total money earned by him with IPO+SPO should be 11,400,000L; that is about 45,600 USDs. He claims with insufficient evidence that he only received 5,280,000L (and he even has the nerve to try to remove from these earnings Capex fees, paid with shareholder money). In any case, he confessed that he received from the IPO+SPO 21,035 USDs (at current rate of 251 Lindens per USD).

In all these years, he only paid back about 5,252,364L (check the scan above) and he pocketed half of them. So, he got 11,400,000L from shareholders (or, in his version, at least, 5,280,000L; 21,035 USDs), but only paid dividends to them of about 2,625,000L (10,500 USD). Thus, he directly stole from the shareholders more than 35,000 USDs. Even in his confessed version, he directly stole 10,535 USD.

He couldn’t run away with the money, he would lose all those earnings of Second Ads. So, in the first months after the SPO, he paid honest dividends. But, then, slowly, he started to test his luck. Let’s lower the dividends and see if something bad happens. Nothing happen? Let’s stop paying according to the plan.

He hasn’t pay any real dividends for more than 2 years. He only paid a few bucks. He lowered all the dividends (check the scan above) since the middle of 2012 in a deliberated policy to stop rewarding shareholders and lowering the stock price. At that time, he was thinking to buy the shares at very low prices. But later he decided he didn’t have to even try to buy back the shares. He could just keep ignoring shareholders’ complaints.

For instance, check:  https://marixgroup.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/open-letter-to-wili-clip/

He decided to do a reverse stock split ten to one on 22/11/2013 with the same intention (against the will of most of the other shareholders). Even taking in account that the number of shares went from 17,500,000 to 1,750,000, the stock price crashed from about 1.75 per share in 2012 to 0.08, being now at about 0.2.

All shareholders are losing serious money because of this crime.

At least the last SPO was made when he was already planning about stop paying dividends, so this was a fraud. He would never sell more than 50% of the shares if he wasn’t thinking about scamming shareholders. According to the prospect (http://www.secondads.com/ADS_SPO_Prospectus.pdf), he intended to end up with just about 1/3 of the shares.

Beside the money earned by the IPO+SPO, Brda also stop paying dividends that he had a duty to pay to shareholders. But he simple decided to ignore the rights of the other shareholders and stole all the profits to himself. That is also a crime of embezzlement under any National Law. Actually, he has less than 50% of the shares, so he is stealing from the majority owners of Second Ads.

The global amount of dividends stolen, currently, in February of 2016, amounts to 6,095,200 Lindens. At 251 lindens per 1 USD, that is 24283 USDs.

Let's show the math that justifies this figure. Brda had a duty to pay monthly dividends, as he did in 2011 and 2012. Let's accept as good the median amount he paid each month in 2011, even if since that he expanded business, with more games and customers. Remember, he claims on the page quoted above (https://www.onlinecapex.com/symbol/ADS/profile) ADS has a monthly profit of 1,443,000L. But let's use conservative numbers and calculate his duty based on the 2011 numbers.

He paid during 2011 in dividends about 2,742,000L in round numbers. Divided for the 9 months where he paid dividends, we get a median amount of 304,666L per month. Let's make it 300,000. So, according to the values paid when ADS was a starting company, he has a duty to pay 300,000 lindens in dividends per month.

In 2012, he paid 2,389,000L. But he had a duty to pay 3,600,000 (12x300,000). Therefore, he didn't pay 1,211,000. The other shareholders had a right to receive about half of this amount (since he had more or less 50% of the shares of ADS). So, in 2012, he stole from shareholders 605,500 lindens.
In 2013, he only paid 70,000 lindens. He failed to pay 353,0000, therefore he stole from shareholders 50%: 1,765,000
In 2014, he only paid 47,000. He failed to pay 3553000, consequently he stole 50% of that: 1,776,500
In 2015, he only paid 1,000. He failed to pay 3599000, consequently he stole 50% of that: 1,799,500
In 2016, he only paid 2,600. He failed to pay 297400, consequently he stole 50% of that: 148,700

Therefore, even if we accepted the amounts he confessed as the money he earned with the IPO and SPO [2,280,00 (IPO)+3,000,000 (SPO) = 5,280,000 Lindens, that is 21,035 USDs], to this amount we would have to add at least the 6,095,200 Lindens (24283 USDs) stolen in dividends from 2012 until February 2016. The total stolen by Brda from the shareholders would be 45318 USDs.

But according to his own SPO prospectus and posts, the total he earned from the IPO and SPO was 11,400,000L; that is about 45,600 USD. With all the stolen dividends, he stole a total of 17,495,200 Lindens or 69,701 USDs.

Of course, this figures are very conservative and can be changed later, after the discovery of evidences about the real profits of ADS. It's possible that he real is making  1,443,000 monthly (5749 USDs) as he claims.


Be aware, he uses bitcoin on a few of his games:

Hi!

I have 41,748 peoples part of Goldtokens Community Network.... you think I am scammer.

What ya goin to do anyway?

*Hi5*

Brda's sentence means "I might be a scammer, but you can't do nothing about it".


                                                      *     *      *

The currency used was the Linden Dollar, a virtual currency of Second Life, sold and bought by the company that owns Second Life, Linden Research Inc., at a pegged value to the US Dollar.

Thus, it's a fully convertible virtual currency, regulated by the American Authority FINCEN.  "This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency." "Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA."(see http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html)

The Linden Dollar is important enough to be the object of a study by the European Central Bank together with Bitcoin (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf).

There are already court sentences deciding that rights created on Second life or other "Virtual" Worlds are legal rights and that abusive acts committed there are legal crimes:

"The Dutch Supreme Court has determined that online video game theft is just as much of a crime as real life theft."

http://www.virtualpolicy.net/runescape-theft-dutch-supreme-court-decision.html


On May 30, 2007, Judge Robreno of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denied Rosedale’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (...). The Court also denied Linden Lab’s motion to compel arbitration, finding that the Terms of Service represented an adhesion contract that was unjustly biased towards Linden Lab. (...). On October 4, 2007, Linden Lab announced that it reached a confidential settlement with Bragg"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_v._Linden_Lab


"According to a class action settlement that was recently approved by a California magistrate judge, Linden Research Inc. will pay a mixture of real and virtual money to Second Life gamers who claim they were deceived about their “ownership” rights in the virtual world."

Eros, LLC et al v. Linden Research, Inc. et al U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. 09-cv-04269, Filed September 15, 2009
This case was moved from court to private mediation on October 7, 2010 and plaintiffs filed for voluntary dismissal of the charges on March 15, 2011 under FRCP 41(a). (...) In this case it appears that a satisfactory solution was reached in ADR leading the plaintiffs to end their civil court case. The court dismissed the case on March 16, 2011.

"Eros LLC filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against a Second Life avatar named Volkov Catteno, temporarily named "John Doe" in court documents, for copying and reselling his virtual SexGen beds. Through several subpoenas served to Linden Lab, PayPal, AT&T and Charter Communications, Volkov Catteno was identified as Robert Leatherwood of Azle, Texas."

The rule is very simple and obvious: if someone steals something with economic value, he is a criminal. This applies even to things from kid games or kid collections, like baseball cards.


As all here at bitcointalk know, the same can be said about bitcoin, even if bitcoin was a commodity, which it isn't:

There is no doubt that the Second Life avatar Wili Clip is operated by the slovenian Andrej Brda.

He was explicitly mentioned on several websites associated with Second Ads (secondads.com, goldtokens.net, kingdomsandempires.com, avatarads.net, linkpie.net, second-website.com) until he decided to start scamming shareholders and tried to hide his identity using whoisguard.

But his identity is still registered at several sites:

The address Street Tomsiceva 3 (Tomšičeva ulica 3), Lendava, Slovenia, is correct (except the postal code; now it’s 9220). It’s the address of the Brda family. I’m not going to post his father’s name or the current phone number, since he isn't guilty of Brda’s crimes. But it isn’t Brda's current address, since he is living in the center of Ljubljana.

Beside the email brda.andrej@gmail.com, he also published on the Internet the email bbrda@hotmail.com and his own phone, the same used to register the websites. The number seems to still be active: +386040601934 (we sent Brda the same SMS we sent his father).

For instance, check http://zasluzek.mojforum.si/zasluzek-post-7712.html


Andrej Brda is a former judo player from Slovenia. Here he is as a kid:







Currently, he lives in Ljubljana, Osrednjeslovenska, Slovenia.







Of course, Wili Clip denies being Andrej Brda. We shouldn't expect a different reaction.

But he was foolish enough to publish using Andrej Brda name this picture of himself side by side with a Second Life Avatar:



Check http://profileengine.com/people/chiliy/andrej.brda

Well, the Wili Clip avatar changed over time, but once he had exactly this appearance. Something easily verifiable by this other picture Brda also made the favor of

uploading:



Brda also had this page http://www.slideshare.net/wiliclip (now empty) where he wrote:

    Name Andrej
    Location Lendava, Slovenia
    Website www.second-website.com

(see https://web.archive.org/web/20100415225729/http://www.slideshare.net/wiliclip)

He also had this page at http://twitter.com/wiliclip/ that said Wili Clip was from Slovenia. Brda deleted the page, after CryptocurrencyNetwork found it, but a scan is posted here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1346981.msg13835911#msg13835911

On an IM chat in world with a shareholder, he posted a link using the slovenian google. This just confirms that he is from Slovenia.

There can be no doubt whatsoever that the scammer and criminal Wili Clip is the slovenian former judo player and programmer Andrej Brda.

In 2014, this criminal created a company in Slovenia on the area of programming:

Andrej Brda je resnična oseba pod Second Life avatar Wili Clip.

On je CEO Drugemu oglasi, eden izmed najbolj dobičkonosnih podjetij v Second Life. Trdi, ki imajo mesečne prihodke v višini 1.600.000 lip s stroški le 157.000

lipe (potrdite tukaj: https://www.onlinecapex.com/symbol/ADS/profile)


V letih 2011 in 2012, je bil pri čemer na nekaterih mesecih 400,000-650,000 lipe v obliki dividend:

Potrdi tukaj: https://www.onlinecapex.com/dividends/history/ADS (boste potrebovali račun Capex za dostop do te strani).

Ob upoštevanju vrste običajno vrednost lipe okoli 1 USD = 250 lip, govorimo o mesečnem prihodkov 6400 USDs.

Marca 2011 je Andrej Brda na začetno javno ponudbo delnic v njegovi družbi na Second Life Stock Exchange SL Capex (www.onlinecapex.com) in, septembra 2011 je naredil dodatna javna ponudba. Zaradi zalog odseku od 1 do 5, je družba končala s 17,500,000 delnic in CEO z le 47,3% od njih.

IPO je bilo za 1.200.000 delnic na 2L v skupnem znesku delnic 3.000.000 (http://www.sluniverse.com/php/vb/commercial-announcements/55757-second-ads-has-launched-ipo. html), s čimer se je skupno Brda zaslužili bil 2,400,000L.
SPO je bila za več 1.500.000 delnic, vendar pa 6L vsak (preverite https://www.onlinecapex.com/home/story/ADS/4030). Brda žep 9,000,000L.
Zato je skupni denar, ki ga zaslužili z IPO + SPO je 11,400,000L; da je približno 45.600 USDs.

V vseh teh letih se je le vrne približno 5,252,364L (preverite skeniranje zgoraj) in je v žep polovico od njih. Torej, je dobil 11,400,000L delničarjev, vendar le izplačala dividende, ki so jim približno 2,625,000L (10.500 USD). Tako je neposredno ukradel delničarjev več kot 35.000 USDs. [/ B]

Ni mogel pobegnil z denarjem, bi izgubili vse tiste zaslužka Second oglasi. Torej, v prvih mesecih po SPO, je plačal poštene dividende. Ampak, potem pa počasi, je začel testirati svojo srečo. Oglejmo nižje dividende, in videli, če se kaj slabega zgodi. Nič zgodilo? Nehajmo plačujejo v skladu z načrtom.

On je ne plača nobenih pravih dividende za več kot 2 leti. On je plačal le nekaj dolarjev. Povesil vse dividende (preverite skeniranje zgoraj) od sredine leta 2012 v premišljeno politiko ustaviti nagrajevanje delničarje in spuščanje na ceno delnic. V tistem času, je mislil, da kupujejo delnice po zelo nizkih cenah. Kasneje pa se je odločil, da ni bilo treba niti poskušal odkupiti delnice. On bi kar naprej ignorira pritožbe delničarjev.

Odločil se je narediti reverse stock split deset na enega na 22/11/2013 z istim namenom, (proti volji večine drugih delničarjev). Tudi ob upoštevanju vrste, da se je število delnic, ki se je vrgel iz 17,500,000 za 1.750.000, cena delnic strmoglavila od približno 1,75 na delnico v letu 2012 na 0,08, pri čemer so zdaj na približno 0,2.

Vsi delničarji so izgubili resno denarja, ker tega kaznivega dejanja.

Vsaj je bil zadnji SPO je, ko je bil že načrtuje okoli prenehalo plačevati dividende, tako da je to prevara. Nikoli ne bi prodal več kot 50% delnic, če ne bi razmišljal o scamming delničarje. [/ B] V skladu z možnostjo (http://www.secondads.com/ADS_SPO_Prospectus.pdf~~HEAD=pobj), je nameraval končati s skoraj 1/3 delnic.

Brda prejela 45.600 ameriških dolarjev v lipe z IPO in SJM je storiti, ampak preprosto odločil, da ne upoštevajo pravice drugih delničarjev in ukradel vse dobičke zase. To je tudi kaznivo dejanje poneverbe v skladu s katero koli nacionalno zakonodajo. Pravzaprav ima manj kot 50% delnic, tako da je kradel od večinskih lastnikov rabljenih oglasi. [/ B]

Zavedajte se, on uporablja Bitcoin na nekaj njegovih iger:
